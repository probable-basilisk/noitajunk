# Noita Junk
Modding junk for noita

## Installation
Get setup for mods (unpack your wak, etc.). Copy the `mod_cheatgui/` folder
into your `Noita/mods/` directory. Enable the cheatgui mod from the mods
menu.

## Note about paths
Right now I'm having the mod put all its files into the global `data/hax/`
path rather than into the mod-specific path, both because I'm lazy, and
also because I might want to cross-load some of these files from other things.
